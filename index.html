  <h1>Advanced Pio Tools (beta)</h1>
 Advanced Pio Tools is a program that contains various tooling for PioSolver. APT is compatible with Pio2 and Pio3. 
 
<h3>
  Tree Pruning
 </h3>
 One functionality of APT is to prune existing sims to only use the highest ev subset of betsizes for a given node. APT does this by creating subtrees for the spot, testing out each bet size (or subset of bet sizes) individually, choosing the highest EV bet size, and node locking that strategy onto the original sim.

  Here is an example of a BB vs BTN 3BP sim where the turn cbet node has been locked to use a single size, despite the original sim having 3 different bet sizes at this node.

  APT also provides tooling to generate hand histories from Pio sims, save the hands you have played vs the solver at hand history files, and re-solve batches of sims to higher accuracy. APT is currently still in it's beta phase, but is fully functional and is being offered for $250 USD.
