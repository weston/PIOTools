  Tree Pruning
 </h3>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnr6Kv5Fj94"> Here is a video explaining tree pruning</a>
  <br/>
  One functionality of APT is to prune existing sims to only use the highest ev subset of betsizes for a given node. APT does this by creating subtrees for the spot, testing out each bet size (or subset of bet sizes) individually, choosing the highest EV bet size, and node locking that strategy onto the original sim.

  <br/><br/>
  Here is an example of a BB vs BTN 3BP sim where the turn cbet node has been locked to use a single size, despite the original sim having 3 different bet sizes at this node.

  APT also provides tooling to generate hand histories from Pio sims, save the hands you have played vs the solver at hand history files, and re-solve batches of sims to higher accuracy. APT is currently still in it's beta phase, but is fully functional and is being offered for $250 USD.

  The installer can be found at <a href="https://apt-installer.s3.amazonaws.com/advanced-pio-tools-1.0.0+Setup.exe">here</a>. You can pay for the full version of the software within the app itself. Please link your solver, and make sure that you can generate a few hand histories before buying the full version. Please, join the <a href="https://discord.gg/Rkuyy93MRc">discord</a> for this project if you have any questions. 
<h3>
  FAQ
</h3>
1. Why does my sim exploitability go up after pruning the tree?
<br/>
It's mostly because of a side effect of re-saving a Pio file that is not a full save. Because the river nodes (and possibly turn nodes) are unsolved when we load a sim and save it, the solver caches the exploitability using the default strategy of mixing every action at equal proportion. However, that doesn't really matter because we delete those nodes anyway when we save it anyway.
<br/><br/>
2. Can you add X feature?
<br/>
Maybe. Suggest it in the discord.
<br/><br/>
3. Does this work with JeSolver? Pio2? Pio3?
<br/>
Yes to all.
